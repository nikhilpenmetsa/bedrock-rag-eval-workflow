However, by the time the bill passed the Senate, guided by Democrat Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, it had more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The \"Sugar Trust\" in particular made changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer. It imposed an income tax of two percent to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions. Cleveland was devastated that his program had been ruined. He denounced the revised measure as a disgraceful product of \"party perfidy and party dishonor,\" but still allowed it to become law without his signature, believing that it was better than nothing and was at the least an improvement over the McKinley tariff.', 'Cleveland refused to allow Eugene Debs to use the Pullman Strike to shut down most of the nation\\'s passenger, freight and mail traffic in June 1894.

The power of this legislation was greater than previous anti-trust laws, because individual officers of corporations could be held responsible if their companies violated the laws.
